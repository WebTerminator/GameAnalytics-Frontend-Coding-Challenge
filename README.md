## How to run the app locally

- run `yarn` or `npm install`
- to run the application `npm run server`
- to verify tests `npm run test`

## Considerations

-	In an ideal scenario the unit test coverage will need to be increased.
-	The MVC design pattern has been used to arrange the code. In my opinion, React would have been a better choice because it helps to arrange the UI in a more modular fashion and it's easier to manage the state.
-	The look and feel has been managed by pure CSS but styled components or even SASS would make the development more effective.
- The application is not fully responsive but that could be easily achieved.
